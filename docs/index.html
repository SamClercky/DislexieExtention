                    Welcome to the site of a beautiful project. This project is opensource and contains (for now) only an extention for chrome
                    The extention helps people who have dyslexia; it uses the OpenDyslexic-font, an award winning invention made for this purpose.
                    With this extention you can change all the text on a webpage in the OpenDyslexic-font. Also a colored background can help better reading 
                    so you can choose a color and use it as the background color of the text when you hover it with the cursor.
